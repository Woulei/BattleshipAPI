# BattleShip

## About
This API uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.
We build it during the Codaisseur Academy. It is used for the [BattleShip App](https://github.com/Woulei/BattleshipUI) that we build during class.

__NOTE:__ This was build during the Academy. If we would build it again, we might do it differently. Also the finishing touches were skipped due to the small amount of time available. The Battleship API and APP were build within less then 5 days by a team of 3 people. It might contain some minor bugs ;-)

## Services
The API has a few services.
